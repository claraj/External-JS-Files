  <!--Notice the order than the scripts are added
  If mainscript needs to access any function etc. from google's code
  or from our own utilities.js, they need to be loaded first.

  The problem with Google's code is that it will probably take longer
  to load than our scripts. The callback parameter takes the name
  of a function, and then it will call that function once Google's code
  has loaded. So callback=mapCode calls a function called mapCode once
  Google's code has loaded. mapCode() is in mainscript.js.  -->
